# Tokenlistooor

### A quick history
Two years ago, Uniswap launched the [Original Token Lists](https://tokenlists.org/) project. It was described as a community-driven initiative to improve the discoverability, reputation, and trustworthiness of ERC20 token lists in a manner that is inclusive, transparent, and decentralized.

Although widely used, this project has been neglected on the updates side, resulting in its current state of either death or near death: 
- Spam-ridden ([cf1](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists/issues), [cf2](https://github.com/Uniswap/tokenlists-org/issues)).
- Outdated (some lists have not been updated for two years).
- Broken (some lists are no longer functional).

It's difficult to assign blame for this project's woes. One of the hallmarks of open source is that anyone can contribute when they feel something is wrong. Moreover, for those of us who have had to work with these lists and build token lists, maintaining them, or even just computing the tokens in the desired format, is an extra task we'd rather not do.

These lists are great resources for token discovery, scripts and apps, but their reliability is currently questionable.
